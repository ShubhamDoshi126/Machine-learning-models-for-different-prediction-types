Machine Learning Models Project Readme

Overview
This project demonstrates the workflow for training and evaluating machine learning models using three different datasets: IMDb for binary classification, Reuters for multiclass classification, and Boston Housing for regression. It includes functionalities for data preparation, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
